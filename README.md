# A Guilded Bot for the text-based MMORPG Torn City

# Introduction
This is a very simple self-hosted bot for the social platform Guilded to help you fetch information out of the game and monitor several statistics.
## Installation
This project is mainly coded in python, the repository includes a virtual environment, so there is no dependency hell to worry about, the releases page will contain a file that can run as long as you have python installed. Documentation on how to configure the bot will be added once we have established what to configure
## Donating
If you feel like this is a project that has helped you greatly, you can let me know your gratuity and if you want to support me, I am open to it.
